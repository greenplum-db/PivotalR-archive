Description: Provides an R interface for the Pivotal Data stack
    running on 'PostgreSQL', 'Greenplum' or 'Apache HAWQ (incubating)'
    databases with parallel and distributed computation ability for big data
    processing. 'PivotalR' provides an R interface to various database
    operations on tables or views. These operations are almost the same as
    the corresponding native R operations. Thus users of R do not need
    to learn 'SQL' when they operate on objects in the database. It also
    provides a wrapper for 'Apache MADlib (incubating)', which is an open-
    source library for parallel and scalable in-database analytics.
