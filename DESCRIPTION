Description: R wrapper of Pivotal Data Fabrics running on PostgreSQL or Pivotal (Greenplum) database with parallel and distributed computation ability for big data analytics. PivotalR is a package that enables users of R to interact with the Pivotal (Greenplum) Database as well as Pivotal HD/HAWQ for Big Data analytics. It does so by providing an interface to the operations on tables/views in the database. These operations are almost the same as those of data.frame. Thus the users of R do not need to learn SQL when they operate on the objects in the database. It also provides a wrapper for MADlib, which is an open-source library for parallel and scalable in-database analytics.
